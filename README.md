**Regularized logistic regression and decision boundary**

Exercise in french to build decision boundary with logistic regression
Decision boundaries associated to 2D data, are a good way to understand the concepts Bias and Variance.
This exercise presents with a training set :
- how to explore 2D data
- how to build polynomial logistic regression by creating from scratch polynomial features
- how to use gradient descent and regularization to estimate parameters of the model
- the influence of regularization on predictions and decision boundary
